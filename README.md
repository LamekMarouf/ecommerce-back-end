# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This application is used to store data in a database. You can then use an application like Insomnia to make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to find, store, update and delete data.

To start the application, you will need to run an "npm install" within the server.js integrated terminal. Then, you will need to create your own .env file with your DB_PASSWORD, DB_USER and DB_NAME. Following this step, you will then have to run "source (db/)schema.sql" within the mySql terminal. After the database has been created, you will have to run "npm run seed" within the integrated terminal to seed the database. Finally, run the "npm run start" command, and the server should be running on PORT 3001. Open Insomnia or a similar appliaction, and you will then be able make requests.
